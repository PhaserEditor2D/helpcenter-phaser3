- The JSDocEditor inspector should show links to open the doc entry in: 
	- editors
	- views 
	- Phaser website.
	- Github.
- A doc-entry landing page? It is a page used for sharing doc links. So it shows the element without distractions. And it shows the links to the Phaser website and Github.
	Nah! I think the official Phaser website is good enough: https://newdocs.phaser.io/docs/3.54.0/focus/Phaser.GameObjects.Blitter-alpha
	But well, the Phaser website does not show meta tags for social networks. So maybe what I can do is a "doc card" service.
- Parse {@link http://some.url}
- The Versions view.
- A welcome editor.
- An Examples Assets view, for showing all the assets. It can help on creating new examples.
And may help finding the examples associated with a particular asset?
- Enable search in all files.
- Enable minimap in the source file editor.
